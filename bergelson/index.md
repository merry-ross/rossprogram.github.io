Having run advanced courses at the Ross Mathematics Program online in
Summer 2020, we will continue Prof. Vitaly Bergelson's advanced
courses during the academic year.

You can review the [notes on equidistribution](./Equidistribution_Notes.pdf)
from the summer course.

Our first academic year meeting was Tuesday, October 13 at 6pm Eastern
[in our Zoom
room](https://zoom.us/my/rossmath?pwd=R2dSMG1ETDltRVNGT2tvT1hDcEg5dz09).
We will continue to meet every two weeks, i.e., alternating Tuesdays,
but now at **6:30 PM** Eastern Time.  The next meeting will be October 27.

    NOTE THE TIME CHANGE.
